### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts - specifically the Outfit and Young Serif font family, enhancing the stylistic delivery of the component.

### What I learned
I learned about structuring a webpage using semantic HTML elements, styling with CSS, and utilizing Flexbox for layout. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
none
```
```css
.body{
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: flex-start; 
    align-items: center;
}
    
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on refining my CSS skills, particularly in areas such as responsive design and CSS layout techniques. Additionally, I aim to explore more advanced CSS features and frameworks to enhance my development workflow.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts - Outfit]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap') - This helped me aquire the font needed for the project.
